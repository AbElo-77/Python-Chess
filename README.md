## About

This project is an attempt to build a chess AI that mimics a player’s style by training models on their game data. It combines chess logic, data storage, and machine learning to evolve an adaptive opponent.  

It is being developed using Python, SQL, and specialized chess / ML libraries. Future improvements include increasing the size of the dataset, along with incorporating a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) model.

## Features

- Chess move validation, game state management  
- Adaptive AI opponents trained on personal game data  
- ML Analysis, combined usage of convolutional, recurrent, and graph neural networks. 
- Frontend (UI) + backend API  
- Persistence (SQL database) for storing games, model checkpoints, etc.  
- Logging, metrics, evaluation
